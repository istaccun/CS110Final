Purpose: This page is the "About" page, where the user can learn more about
Network.  There are no javascript applications on this page, but there is a
hover function made possible by CSS.  There is text content under the headings
"History" and "Mission".  The tiles making up the "aboutphotos" div are
styled with CSS to make them interactive.  When the user hovers over the
headshots, the information relevant to each headshot appears over a
darkened image.

        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p> We were founded in 2013 by Karen Shih and Don Leach, who wanted
        to create a network of resources for first generation students at
        Wellesley.  Together, with the help of their student coordinators, they
        built the Network to be the first gen community that Wellesley so needed.

    <div id="mission">

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p> The goals of the First Generation Network are:
            <ol>
                <li>To connect First Gen Students to one another and by so doing
                    build a network of peer resources
                <li>To connect First Gen Students to faculty and staff and by so
                    doing build a network of mentors and mentees
                <li>To extend the network into First Gen Wellesley Alumni and to
                    seek their assistance in addressing the concerns of
                    employment and further education after Wellesley
                <li>To connect First Gen Student experiences to the diversity/
                    inclusion goals of the college and division: issues of class
                    , ethnicity, gender, and citizenship not only intersect with
                    but also provide integrative focus for the curricular and
                    co-curricular aspects of a Wellesley College education
            </ol>

    <!-- Within the div with the id "aboutphotos", is the small gallery of
        coordinators' headshots.  When the user hovers over one of the
        headshots, the corresponding name and position appears over the image.
        This was originally going to be a javascript application, but I found a
        better way to do it in CSS, by adapting some code from Geek Girl Life.-->
