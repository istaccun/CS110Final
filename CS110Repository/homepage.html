Purpose: The purpose of this page is to serve as an introduction to the
     Network.  The page utilizes one javascript application (in addition to the
     javascript drop down menu that each page utilizes) which makes the
     thumbnail image gallary pictures clickable and fill the larger figure
     floated left.  In addition, we have text describing the mission and
     history of the Network.
