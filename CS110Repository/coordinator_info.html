            When in college I wondered, “Who are these middle-class folks who
            are my friends?  They were my friends but I knew that in one respect
            I was not one of them.  My class origins are fuzzy, perhaps not
            entirely decipherable, and yet when I say, “My Dad was a painter, a
            laborer, in a paper mill,” more than a trace is drawn to working-
            class.  I did also wonder, “What’s the point of college and of my
            being a student?” Very much a First Gen kid, I was troubled by not
            being able to answer such questions. I knew I liked to read and
            write, and had the great good fortune of having a professor-become-
            mentor who recognized that I could do these things. College became a
            place for receiving unexpected, unexpected because unknown,
            acknowledgment. To give new possibility to First Gen kids is very
            much the point of my involvement in the First Gen Network.  It’s
            where I can let my hair down and give back what I’ve received.

            I am proud to be a first generation student who has become an
            educator in higher education. It makes me very happy when first
            generation students take pride and know that they are not alone.
            My passion is to build our community of first generation faculty,
            staff, students, and alumnae.
