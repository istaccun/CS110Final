FILE NAME: splashpage.html
WRITTEN BY: Isabel Staccuneddu and Christine Tang

PURPOSE: This page serves as the splash page and introduction to our website.
There are two javascript applications on this page.  The first is the link titled
"JOIN", which brings the user to our homepage.  The javascript for this is
expandText.js, and makes the word "JOIN" expand horizontally as the user hovers
over it.  The second is the image carousel.  The carousel is displayed in the
"carousel" figure using the jQuery in the imageCarousel.js file.  These features
make the website enticing to enter.
