FILE NAME: submit.html

PURPOSE: This page allows the user to submit their own story to FGN.  We were
going to use an Ajax form, but our client required that there be a first line of
security in that only those with Wellesley.edu usernames could submit stories.
Therefore, we have embedded a Google form I wrote for a FGN Wellesley.edu email
I set up specifically for collecting form responses.  This page uses no
javascript applications.
