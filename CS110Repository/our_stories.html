     Generation community at Wellesley.  We do this by profiling a few
     prominent faces on campus - faculty, staff, and students.  The user can
     select which category they want to peruse from the navbar on the side which
     uses fragment URLs to link to the different sections of the page(faculty,
     staff, and students). Content is missing for students and
     faculty because our client received no submissions yet. This page uses no

        When I think back about exploring colleges and going to college while
        being first-generation, I had some luck to help balance some of the
        misfortunes. A good friend of mine whose parents had completed college
        let me tag along while my friend visited the schools he was interested
        in attending. I don’t think my parents or I knew that this was part of
        the search process. We never spoke about where I might go to school, how
        much it might cost or really anything else on the subject.<br>

        </br>I never really knew how much money my father earned at work. I always
        assumed we were probably middle-class with a bit of a tight budget with
        4 children. When any of us tried to get him to fill out financial
        paperwork, he was always hesitant and rarely did it. Neither of us knew
         much about the financial aid process, or maybe he did and didn’t want to
         disclose, but on applying to schools I discovered that I was accepted
         at most of them but that my father hadn’t completed the financial paper
         work. The one school my friend had not visited and which we were always
        told to put down as a backup, was where I attended school, the University
        of Massachusetts at Amherst.<br>

    </br>I have no regrets going to UMass Amherst but at the time I was accepted
        and agreed to go, the school had the nickname  Zoo Mass. When my teachers
        heard where I was going to school, they appeared disappointed. Again, I
        didn’t know the difference between one school or another and hadn’t seen
         UMass and assumed that the most affordable school with the most academic
          options was the best place for me.  Again, no financial aid to me meant
          that I was paying for school myself.<br>

      </br>My family drove me out to school and helped unload everything in my
        residence hall. I was fortunate that a high school friend who moved off
        to Chicago at the end of our sophomore year and I were going to be
        roommates. In some ways he and I both were fortunate that his sister was
         already there as a Junior.  We really didn’t know what to do despite
         having gone to orientation. I remember getting there before him, a day
         or 2, and before the dining halls were open and not having a clue where
          to get food or how to find out.  If it wasn’t for his sister helping
          us through the basics, I think we both would’ve been floundering a lot
           more than we were.<br>

       </br>I also don’t recall having much spending money and never really asked my
         parents for any. I know that I had worked throughout high school and
         had some savings but I think my thoughts were that my dining hall bill
         was covered and my housing was paid for so what else did I need money
         for. I definitely was on a low budget that 1st year. Without financial
         aid, I didn’t have work-study monies or information about getting jobs
         so I really didn’t think much about doing so. My 1st priority was to do
          well in classes. I remember signing up for an intramural tennis compet
          ition and getting beat up by the best player on campus which dampened
          my enthusiasm to play in a formal format. There was plenty to do going
           to sporting events which was covered by our student IDs, gyms and
           doing social things with others on campus.<br>

       </br>Many other things occurred over my years at UMass Amherst again making
        it a fortunate accident to have been there. The experience though has
        made me passionate about helping those who are also first-generation and
         might benefit from the knowledge I gained.

        I am an administrative solutions technologist in Library and Technology
        Services.  I began working at Wellesley College in 1987.  I am named
        after my grandmother who came to Newton, MA from Ireland in the 1920’s.
         Because of her, I have dual citizenship with Ireland.   My grandmother
         worked as a housekeeper and cook.  She had six daughters and died
         suddenly when my mother was 14.  My mother didn’t get to attend college
          because of responsibilities she had caring for her younger sisters.
          I am one of five children in my family and the first to go to college.
            I received my BA from UMass Amherst, where I was elected to Phi Beta
            Kappa.  I also completed a project management certification program
            at Bentley University.  I believe strongly in giving back to my
            alma mater.  I volunteer for alumni and athletics organizations
            and mentor students.  I was very proud when both of my sons chose
            to attend and graduated from UMass Amherst.<br>

        </br>I’ve been a lifelong advocate for public education, and am passionate
        about politics and global issues.  I am a board member at the Cornell
        University Institute for Internet Culture, Policy, and Law.  I recently
        completed a two-year term as the public policy coordinator for the
        Massachusetts State Advisory Board of NASPA (Student Affairs
        Professionals in Higher Education) and I’m now serving on the
        Massachusetts Democratic Party Public Policy Subcommittee. I was a member
        of the Education and Technology Subcommittee for the Commonwealth
        Readiness Project, a statewide initiative to develop a ten-year
        strategic plan for Massachusetts public education.

        When I arrived in Poughkeepsie for my freshman year at Vassar College,
        I had never heard the term “First Gen.”  I knew that I had received a
        significant scholarship to attend this prestigious liberal arts college,
         but did not know that it was because of a progressive financial aid
        policy later known as “need-blind.”  I knew that it was special to be
        the first person in my family to go to college, but as I embarked on my
        college career, I did not anticipate the many struggles that I would face
        being from a lower-middle class family and studying at an elite institution.<br>

        </br> Working through these challenges made me a stronger person.  They define
        my identity and inform my teaching philosophy.  As a museum educator,
        I’m deeply committed to accessibility in art museums. I strive to create
        learning experiences that welcome anyone to engage with art, regardless
        of their class status, race, gender, sexual orientation, or faith.  I
        firmly believe that art museums should be spaces for everyone, despite
        persisting beliefs in our society that museums are only for privileged
        audiences.  My experiences as a First Gen student inspire me to work
        towards this kind of social change in the museum field.<br>

        </br> I graduated from Vassar College with a BA in Art History, and later from
        the Rhode Island School of Design with an MA in Teaching + Learning in
        Art + Design, Museum Education track. I previously worked at the
        Cincinnati Art Museum and currently work as the Public and Interpretive
        Programs Specialist at the Davis Museum.  In this position, I plan
        public programs and manage the Davis Student Guides, Davis Museum Student
        Advisory Committee (DMSAC), and the Davis Summer Internships.
        I grew up in a rural town south of Boston, and currently reside in Providence,
        RI, with my partner, Alex, and two ridiculous but adorable cats.
