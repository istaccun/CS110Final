     Purpose: This page explains the changes that we have made to our HTML, CSS,
     and javascript to form our final project for CS 110.  This page builds on
     the project proposal we made in firstgendesign.html before we started the
     coding portion of the project.

    <ol>
        <li>Minimum Requirements:<br>
        </br>Isabel fulfilled the javascript requirements by coding the lightbox
             on the "Media" page and the image carousel on the splashpage.
             Christine fulfilled her javascript requirements by coding the homepage
             image gallery and the drop down menus on each page.  Isabel and
             Christine worked together on coding the expanding text of "JOIN" on
             the splashpage.<br>

        <li>Modularity Requirement:<br>
        </br>Christine used SSI to put the menu with its javascript drop down
             submenus on each page of the website.  Christine was responsible for
             this implementation.<br>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Tab: We added the Wellesley "W" to each of our page tabs.  We
                manipulated it in Photoshop to fit the tabs' dimensions.
            <li>Site-wide Changes: We added a background color of gray for
                aesthetic reasons.
            <li>Splashpage: No changes
            <li>Homepage: We added the logo that Christine designed to the menu.
                We kept the drop down menu the same.  We added an image gallery
                rather than having a static image.  As a result, we added a
                string of thumbnails above the welcome text.
            <li>About: We kept the feature where hovering over the image shows
                the coordinator's name and position, but Isabel acheived the effect
                using extensive CSS instead of a javascript function.  We didn't
                like how the W logo looked in red, though, so we changed it to be
                the classic blue.  We also added a bit more margins between the
                history, mission, and coordinator tiles for aesthetic reasons.
                We cut "Our Vision" and renamed "Goals" to "Mission" at the
                client's request.
            <li>Calendar: No changes
            <li>Coordinator Info: We cut the email addresses because the Network
                is trying to set up one central email address for the
                coordinators and advisors, and the client
                felt that it would be discontinuous to have emails in the bios
                and then to cut the emails later. We dropped the borders between
                bios because it looked distracting.  We also dropped the navbar
                on the side because the client said it was unnecessary.  Karen
                and Don requested that we only use their FGN titles for the
                website, so we also dropped their formal titles from the page.
                We added these FGN titles as figcaptions and contained them
                within an FGN red border.
            <li>Media: Since we added the logo to the menu, we cut it from the
                "Media" page.  We kept the titles of "Media" and then the
                individual events with appropriate thumbnails.  We added the
                lightbox feature.  We got rid of the underline under "Media"
                because we thought it was too much.  We added borders in FGN red
                and rounded corners to draw attention to the photos.
            <li>Our Stories: Instead of having clickable photos that linked to
                a bunch of different webpages, we condensed the photos and stories
                into one page, similar to the "Coordinator Info" page.  It would
                be clunky to have each story link to a new webpage, when they
                all fit fine on a page together.
            <li>Resources: We kept a more transparent FGN red behind the different
                resources, but added a shadow to the boxes to make it more
                professional looking.  
            <li>Submit: No changes
        </ol>
